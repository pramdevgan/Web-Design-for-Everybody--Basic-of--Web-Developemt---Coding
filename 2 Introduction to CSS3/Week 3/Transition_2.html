    <h2>
        Transitional Property
    </h2>
    <p>
        The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. <br>
        In the example above, the background property is identified in the transition-property value. Here the background property is the only property that will change over the duration of 1 second in a linear fashion. Any other properties included when changing an elementâ€™s state, but not included within the transition-property value, will not receive the transition behaviors as set by the transition-duration or transition-timing-function properties.
