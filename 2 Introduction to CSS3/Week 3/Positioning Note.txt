                                    Positioning Properties
. The four position Properties are:
    . static
    . relevant
    . absolute
    . fixed

. Position are modified by the properties: top, left, right, bottom


- static
    . Default value for elements
    . Place in the next available position
    . Not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties

- relevant
    . Postioned "relative to itself"
    . Take the static position, but add offsets
    . The new positioning  does NOT affect any other element. 
      It is possible to move an element and leave a big hole where it would have been.
    . Relatively postitoned elements are often used as container blocks for other elements.

- absolute
    . Element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to it's nearest ancestor (or the root)
    . Other elements behave as if element does not exist
    . Can end up on top of another element

- fixed
    . Postioned relative to the browser window
    . Will not move, even if the window is scrolled 
        - IE7 and IE8 support the fixed value only if a !DOCTYPE is spacified
    . Think of popup boxes that won't go away!!!
    . Or a navigation bar that is always visible on the top

                                        Z-index
. Multiple elements may be placed in the same position.
. z-index is a numeric value, postitive or negative that dictates stacking order
