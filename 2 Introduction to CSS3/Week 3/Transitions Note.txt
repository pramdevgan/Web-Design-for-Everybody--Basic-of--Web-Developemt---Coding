                        Transitions

When elements transition from one state to another,
you can alter their appearance.
    . if you hover over the link, change the color of the link
    . If an image comes into focus, change the size if the image


The Properties
    1 transition-property
        . what is it you want to chnage ? (size,  color, position, etc.)
    2 transition-duration
        . How long should each transition last?
    3 transition-timing
        . Should it be a smooth transition (linear)? or Different?
    4. transition-delay
        . How long should the wait be before the transition begains?


Setting up
1. Define your elements
2. Choose the elements for transition
3. Define the new values
    - Your must combine this step with a pesudo-class

                    Step:
div {
    color: #000000;
    background: #2db34a;
    text-height: 200px;
    text-align: center;
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    transition-property: color, width, background, background-radius;
    transition-duration: .5s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: .5s;
}

div:hover   {
    color: #FFFFFF;
    width: 350px;
    background: #2D31B3;
    border-radius:50%;
}



Using Shorthands
. If you have multiple property transitioning, you can use shorthand:
    transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;
